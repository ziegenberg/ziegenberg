# Hi, I'm Daniel ðŸ‘‹

I work at [TU Wien](https://tuwien.at) as a DevOps Engineer for the Campus Software Development Department.


## Open Source

Every now and then I contribute to Open Source Projects.

- ðŸ”­ Some of those are [ansible-community/schemas](https://github.com/ansible-community/schemas), [ansi2html](pycontribs/ansi2html), [moodle](https://github.com/moodle/moodle/) and [opencast](https://github.com/opencast/opencast/).

I regularly use Open Source Projects.
